# colourmaker
Buttons that control neopixels through arduino. 

Note that the arduino ide wants the ino file in a folder with exactly the same name apart from the ino part - i.e. in this case 'colourmaker'.

In the Development branch the first four buttons control one or several 
identical 'mood-lamps'. The last two buttons control a reading lamp (white 
colour) which can also run a mood program. 

The lamps are turned on and off through toggles on the connected battery
backs, since the pixels drain the battery over time even in an off state if 
they are connected to the battery.
